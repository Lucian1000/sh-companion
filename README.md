# Secret Hitler Companion

Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two or three teams - liberals, fascists and socialists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. While socialists try to hold the backbone of democracy, they still have certain poltical goals they want to achieve. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

## Why another companion app?

Some countries are blocking the orignal companion app in app stores, because of the word "Hitler". With that project I wanted to create a simple web app, which helps the owner of the Secret Hitler tabletop game to organise if with ease. Which and how much roles do I need? Which board should I use now? Which now? And so on. My tabletop group faced the issue everytime when we wanted to play.
