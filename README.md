# Secret Hitler Companion

Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two or three teams - liberals, fascists and socialists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. While socialists try to hold the backbone of democracy, they still have certain poltical goals they want to achieve. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.
